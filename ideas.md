# ideas

As soon as they walk in, we have 10ish different problems that can be solved in 10-20 lines of code. The problems range from UI stuff to more mathematical stuff, but all of it should be relatively easy. 

We give them pencils and paper and tell them to choose 1 of the problems and break it down into as many steps as they can. We help them if they need to break it up further.

Then, when each person reaches the point where they are ready to do the steps, we ask them what they do know and what they don't know. 
    - For stuff they do know, we ask them how you generally do it with code, and we write it down somewhere (they could potentially do this on paper, on their computer, etc.). 
    - For stuff they don't know, we ask them how they might google it, and lead them to a good googling strategy.

After this point, they are on their own, and we won't help them much with the actual coding-- just with the problem solving process.


# Problems for them to solve
(everyone will start out with an HTML file with a canvas and a script link in it as well as a blank JS file)

1. Make a venn diagram by drawing 3 circles on the screen and overlapping them
2. Add up all the numbers from 1 to 100,000,000,000...
3. Censor out a word in a string.
4. Put a string in a box of asterisks
5. Make a short function to take an input of amount of people and tell you how many buses you will need if every bus can fit 30 people in it
6. Make a function to ask the user where they want to go, and depending on what they enter, it will tell them the costs of going to that place (gas money, etc.)
7. Make a function that will let you fill in word like Mad Libs
8. Make a function called `excitify(sentence)` that will replace any periods with exclamation marks
9. Make a function that counts how many of each word there are in a string and saves them to an object (could also graph this primitively)
10. Make a function to add todos to a list

will add more later
