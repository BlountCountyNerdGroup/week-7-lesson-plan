As soon as they walk in, we have 10ish different problems that can be solved in 10-20 lines of code. The problems range from UI stuff to more mathematical stuff, but all of it should be relatively easy. 

We give them pencils and paper and tell them to choose 1 of the problems and break it down into as many steps as they can. We help them if they need to break it up further.

Then, when each person reaches the point where they are ready to do the steps, we ask them what they do know and what they don't know. 
    - For stuff they do know, we ask them how you generally do it with code, and we write it down somewhere (they could potentially do this on paper, on their computer, etc.). 
    - For stuff they don't know, we ask them how they might google it, and lead them to a good googling strategy.

After this point, they are on their own, and we won't help them much with the actual coding-- just with the problem solving process.
