We'll start off by picking choice #1 from the list which says:

"Make a venn diagram by drawing 3 circles on the screen and overlapping them"

We want to break this problem down into as many steps as we can because if we create simple steps, then it's an easy problem.

So what's the first thing that pops out out as something you may not know how to do? (after answer) The first question we'll have to address is "How do I draw a circle?" The only way to find this out is to google it. 

After we find out how to draw the circle, was there any specific way we have to draw the circles? (after response) Yeah, so we need to overlap the circles, meaning that when we draw the circles, we're just going to have to mess around with their positions to get them to overlap.

And just like that, we took a problem, broke it down, and now you can solve it because it's just a bunch of easy problems now.
